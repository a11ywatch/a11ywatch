              It is important to note the steps we are trying to take for the
              ultimate level of compliance with minimal downsides along the way.
              This means we acknowledge that things arent perfect but, we are
              trying our best to provide the best experience to our
              capabilities. The phases we have set are according to difficulty
              and time it will take for the solution. We have rough estimates to
              better our judgement on when we can provide the features to come.
              We are currently on Phase 3

              <Heading variant='h6' component='h4' bold={false}>
                Our initial and simplest phase to get some level of fixes is to
                provide a CDN to override the issues at runtime using
                javascript. We can manipulate the dom to apply the fixes as soon
                as the page loads. The manipulation of the dom in our context
                can be very minimal and fast since everything is synchronous.
                This means that content can adjust quick enough to prevent
                elements from shifting and flickering.

                AI and machine learning has a bit to go to have spot on labeling
                for image recognition. This means we need to have a level of
                accuracy for certainty on our fix being correct. If the
                probability is not near 100% we need to allow developers to edit
                the scripts to the proper label. From our script dashboard panel
                you should be able to live edit the script so that the changes
                can be applied on your custom CDN.

              <Heading variant='h6' component='h4' bold={false}>
                With fixes applied at compile time we no longer need to rely on
                javascript to load the solutions initially. This is a huge
                benefit since the speed of scripts varies greatly on the users
                device. This process would be hooked into your deployment or
                build steps so that way it can run seamless.

                The last step is to provide a way to hook into your development
                process that runs in your own environment. With the dev time
                support we can provide helpful features like injecting visual
                annotations into your actual application so that you can provide
                the remedies automatically to code. At this level we will
                support the most popular front-end frameworks first besides
                basic html support.
