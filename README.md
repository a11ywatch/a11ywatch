## Getting Started

The [CLI](./cli/README.md) can be used to test and build your own instance anywhere.<br>
We have [clients](./clients) in multiple languages and protocols to integrate with your app easier.<br>
See the [documentation](https://docs.a11ywatch.com) for more information on getting started with development and etc.

You can also use the [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/a11ywatch/a11ywatch) with all of the services in one container except the web application.

```yml
version: "3.9"
services:
  a11ywatch:
    image: a11ywatch/a11ywatch
    ports:
      - 3280:3280
```

If you want to integrate your system with A11yWatch the simplest way is to use the javascript [sidecar](https://github.com/a11ywatch/sidecar).

Multi page crawl example with valid a11ywatch instance up ex: (`a11ywatch start`).

## Development

Run the following commands inside a folder to create the workspace.

```sh
mkdir a11ywatch_workspace && cd a11ywatch_workspace

git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/a11ywatch.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/web.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/core.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/pagemind.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/crawler.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/elastic-cdn.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/mav.git
git clone https://github.com/a11ywatch/chrome.git

# navigate to main control repo
cd a11ywatch
docker-compose --file ./docker/docker-compose.yml up # view http://localhost:3280 or http://localhost:3280/graphql
```

The web application starts on port 80 when running `docker-compose up` or [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).
You can also replace the `docker-compose.yml` with `docker-compose.dev.yml` to build development images and use
the env var WEB_PORT to control the front-end port start ex: `WEB_PORT=3000 docker-compose --file ./docker/docker-compose.yml up`.

## [Benchmarks](./benchmarks)

Case: `https://a11ywatch.com` multi site scan.
10x simultaneous runs each ran via localhost to avoid latency.

| **`Nodejs[Axe-Deque]: crawl 10 times against 25 urls`**    | `113 s`           |

A11yWatch helps builds confidence due to handling dynamic parameters and amount of coverage from reports.
It can handle up to 150k pages easily under 1 min with 8gb of memory on linux.
